This is the program based on Vo V. Anhâ€™s creative description of an ultimate AI.  This program, however, ignores the notion of the rooms, and works in a much simpler manner, yet, 
preserving the main idea and a power of archiving the data.


It works like this:
-User inputs the N documents, giving them a rank in percents

-For every new document, the system predicts the rank

-If the rank is within the acceptable range, the user is given the data to read and evaluate from 0 to 100.

-When an ultimate document is obtained (the rank of 100), the ranks of all documents automatically get lower and documents that go below the mark of 33 get removed.

-For each new document inserted into a system, a new dimension to data-prediction model is added, thus adding to a prediction power.

-User can also remove the documents from a collection, so there is no information overload.



Although this is not the strong AI, it is a good research tool that can help create the stronger AI, or to improve itself onto a next new version.
